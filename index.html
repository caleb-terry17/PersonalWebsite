                &emsp; Howdy, I am a Junior Computer Science and Applied Mathmatics double major at Texas A&M University planning on graduating in May of 2023. The simplest way to phrase what I enjoy doing is finding solutions through programming. I thrive on the type of problems that are solved in going about reading a large sum of data, creating an interface, or developing the infrastructure for the platform that the client desires.  
            </p>

                &emsp; I am open to any and all job opportunities in the fields of Software Engineering or Data Science. I have quite a bit of experience which I feel qualifies me for these positions. I have designed a Chess Game which runs out of the command line in C++ that simulates a full game between two opponents. This was quite a challenging project in which I developed all of the logic from start to finish for every piece including how they interact with each other. I also have meaningful experince in building websites. Finally, I have a profound understanding of data structures and have written classes in C++ for various different containers to gain a deeper understanding of how they opperate.
